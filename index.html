                    <p class="paragraf">The official name of the city during the colonial Dutch East Indies period was Bandoeng. 
                        The earliest reference to the area dates back to 1488, although archaeological findings 
                        suggest a type of Homo erectus species had long previously lived on the banks of the 
                        Cikapundung River and around the old lake of Bandung.[10] During the 17th and 18th centuries,
                        the Dutch East Indies Company (VOC) established plantations in the Bandung area. 
                        In 1786, a supply road connecting Batavia (now Jakarta), Bogor, Cianjur, Bandung, Sumedang 
                        and Cirebon was constructed. In 1809, Napoleon Bonaparte, French Emperor and conqueror of much 
                        of Europe including the Netherlands and its colonies, ordered the Dutch Indies Governor 
                        H.W. Daendels to improve the defensive systems of Java to protect against the British in India. 
                        Daendels built a road, stretching approximately 1,000 km (620 mi) from the west to the east coast
                        of Java, passing through Bandung.[11][12] In 1810, the road was laid down in Bandung and 
                        was named De Groote Postweg (or the 'Great Post Road'), the present-day location of Jalan Asia-Afrika.
                        Under Daendels' orders, R. A. Wiranatakusumah II, the Chief Administrator of the 
                        Bandung regency at that time, moved the office from Krapyak, in the south, 
                        to a place near a pair of holy city wells (sumur Bandung), the present-day site of the city square (alun-alun). 
                        He built his dalem (palace), masjid agung (the grand mosque) and pendopo (public-official meeting place) 
                        in the classical Sundanese orientation,[13] with the pendopo facing Tangkuban Perahu mountain, 
                        which was believed to have a mystical ambience.</p>
